        p2:"I can see myself wearing every single palette this summer although my favorites are Medium Coral and Medium Rose Gold. I like that Light Coral is lighter but still shows up my skin. If you have ultra fair skin tone I think Light Coral will be the best option for you. Deep Rose Gold is so beautiful but pulls very dark on my skin. Even with a light hand it’s too dark but that means this will most likely show up on deeper skin tones.",
        p3:"We’ve been collecting the Chanel bronzers every year for as long as I can remember. This year they brought 5 shades and I love how soft and naturally glowy they look on the skin. Each compact has 3 shades you can use individually or swirl together. The compacts are oversized like the ones from 2022. Each color has enough product you can definitely dip your brush into each shade without overlapping colors if you prefer.",

        p1:"Caring for your curly hair can be quite challenging, especially if you aren’t familiar with what works with your hair and what doesn’t. To make the process easier, hair care experts have classified hair into distinct categories and sub-categories based on texture and curl patterns. Curly hair falls into the Type 3 category, which is further divided into 3A, 3B and 3C subcategories. Understanding which category and sub-category your hair falls into is the first and most crucial step giving your hair the TLC it needs. Here’s what you need to know about caring for Type 3 hair.",
        p2:"Shampooing Once A Week  African hair is naturally dry and lacks oil. Gently shampoo your curls once a week for proper cleansing. However, overdoing it can lead to frizz and breakage. Use a sulphate-free shampoo to prevent dryness.    Leave-In Moisturizer   Moisture is your best friend! Use a leave-in moisturiser on days when you don’t wash or condition your hair. TCB Naturals Leave-In Treatment contains a unique blend of shea butter and coconut oil, which deeply moisturizes and nourishes your hair. Regular use can rejuvenate your hair making it silky, smooth and voluminous. Sealing the moisturized hair with oil further helps you trap in the moisture, which in turn promotes hair growth.",
        p3:"Comb It The Right Way  Having curly hair means continuously dealing with knots and tangles. Gently run your fingers through your hair before combing them, this will help eliminate big knots. Make sure you use a wide-toothed comb and avoid tugging too hard. Avoid brushing or combing them from the roots, it causes breakage. Start brushing from the middle and gently make your way up.

But how do you know what does and doesn’t make the perfect skincare partner? Here we give you the lowdown on the art of skincare match-making...",
        p2:"Retinol is a hero ingredient that boosts skin cell turnover, boosts collagen, supports sloughing of dead skin cells, and combats free radical activity to prevent cellular damage. To get nerdie, retinol is a derivative of vitamin A and natural precursor to retinoic acid. Once it’s absorbed into the skin, retinol is converted into retinoic acid, which is the active form of vitamin A, so the skin can reap the benefits of it.",
        p3:"Retinol and vitamin C are two powerhouse active ingredients that have amazing skin-boosting properties but can lead to irritation when layered together. As the use of retinol requires acclimatisation and can be irritating to some, it shouldn’t be used at the same time as vitamin C. This doesn’t mean that the you can’t include both in your regime though! Our Chemist Gabriela recommends using vitamin C underneath your broad-spectrum SPF in the morning as SPF shields the skin from UV rays, while vitamin C combats free radical damage caused by UV exposure. Then, use retinol at night to support the skin’s natural processes of cellular repair and proliferation which occur while you are sleeping.",

My instinct is to reply with the sardonic response, “Why not?” because, let’s face it, there is a multitude of reasons that African-descended women in the United States are angry, disappointed, discouraged, and confused.",

I should have been excited with the anticipation of holding my newest grands, but I wasn’t. I was utterly terrified. I wasn’t worried about her babies. I was worried about my baby. While some might chalk this up to being an overprotective mama bear (which is an identity that I am quite proud of), this is a product of widespread systemic racism exacted against Black and Brown bodies.",
        p3:"The chilling truth is that Black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than White women, and Black infants are two times more likely to die before they turn one. These complications include cardiac conditions, excessive bleeding, infections, blood clots, hypertension disorders, and, most prominently, mental health conditions",

        p1:"For Black mothers who need assistance, especially those who are on the lower rungs of the economic ladder, it can be hard enough to find them while they are busy rearing children, being the sole breadwinner, and being the emotional and foundational support 24/7 with no immediate relief in sight. The adage “it takes a village to raise a child” especially still rings true for the many single mothers who have no choice but to rely on family and friends to babysit their children and provide extended support for them when daycare is too costly and many times out of the question.",
        p2:"In 2020, there were roughly 4.25 million Black families in the United States with a single mother, according to nationwide statistics.

        author:"Peachey Counselling and Family Therapy",
        date:"March 21, 2023",
        p1:"Mom Guilt: The universal theme of motherhood. Mom guilt starts even before pregnancy! We are inundated with advice on what we should do and not do and during pregnancy that guilt grows worse as friends, family, and the media tell us what kind of mother we are expected to be. Once we have our baby, our own second-guessing and ongoing regret for ‘not being perfect’ eats away at us. We didn’t breastfeed, or make our own organic baby food, or get them into that ‘top’ daycare. Then, as our children grow, we find all new reasons to feel guilty. We either didn’t spend enough time or we spent too much time and that’s why every personality flaw, bad behaviour or negative outcome… is all our fault. But why don’t we ever hear about ‘Dad guilt?’",
        p2:"Sleep Deprivation: The ongoing impact of sleep deprivation is dangerous for mental health, contributing to depression, anxiety, stress, panic attacks, and other health problems. Unfortunately, we don’t need any researchers to confirm what we already know. Mothers have gone years with interrupted sleep, and we’re exhausted!  ",
        p3:"Balancing Family and Work: Millions of moms around the world are juggling an overwhelming amount of responsibility. Employers and culture in general, expect women to raise families as if they don’t have careers and work as if they don’t have children. These clashing expectations take a toll, as moms continue to scramble and sacrifice to balance each day leaving too many of us feel stressed out, worn out, and guilty.",
        p4:"Always the Primary Caregiver: When the kids get sick, or there is a parent interview, or Nana needs help remembering to take her medication, women perform the majority of unpaid work caring for others. Whether that’s their own children, whoever is sick or elderly parents and family members.  Despite the fact that men are fully capable, women still carry the  weight and burden of being the primary caregiver.",
        p5:"That Darn Glass Ceiling: Balancing family and work is tough enough, but moms who work outside the house often face a number of barriers and down right discrimination when it comes to employment.  Not only do women earn less than their male counterparts, but most businesses and organizational cultures are disproportionately led by men and reward men with a clear path to upward mobility. Such discrimination can be subtle and difficult to detect and fight… but mansplaining, a lack of female mentors, being passed over for a promotion, not being considered for an opportunity, because you ‘may, will or have kids’ are obvious reasons why that darn glass ceiling still exists.",
        p6:"Violence Against Women: Half of all women in Canada have experienced at least one incident of physical or sexual violence since the age of 16 and 67% of Canadians say they have personally known at least one woman who has experienced physical or sexual abuse. But the most shocking statistic? Approximately every six days, a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. That’s why on any given night in Canada, 3,491 women and their 2,724 children sleep in shelters because it isn’t safe at home. It’s all too much — especially those of us who’d hoped it would be different for our daughters.",
        p7:"Self-worth and body image: Just because we’re moms, doesn’t mean we aren’t affected by body shaming or other’s expectations. We are bombarded by media highlighting celebrity mom bodies — perfectly glowing, fit and without stretch marks. These images make us feel like failures. How can we not compare ourselves to other moms? Why do some women bounce back unscathed while others gain 60 pounds and zebra-like stretch scars? Unfortunately, all of this comparison can lead to a lack of self-worth, self-loathing, and in extreme cases, eating disorders.",
        p8:"Carrying the Mental Load: So how many moms out there can list the 1000 things that need to be done this week, next week or the weeks ahead? When we talk about ‘mental’ load, we’re talking about all those details that moms just ‘take care of.’ Everything from scheduling dentist appointments, to remembering to call Auntie Sue on her birthday, to knowing which one of your kids’ friends has peanut allergies. Moms basically carry all of this information in their head and are typically responsible for making sure that ‘nothing’ gets missed. Unfortunately, all of this internal archiving and maintenance of information becomes taxing. Pretty soon our brains get full and things start to slip… once again fueling stress and guilt. ",
        p9:"Parenting Solo: If you are a single mom, were raised by a single mom or know one, you know that most single mothers are challenged by sleep deprivation, stigma, conflict with their ex-partner, and financial insecurity. Many single moms rely on multiple minimum wage jobs that keep them just above or below the poverty level — even when they’re working full time. Not surprisingly, poverty and economic hardship are linked to anxiety and depression and many single moms - while doing an unbelievable job - are paying the cost with their mental well-being.",
        p10:"Gender Roles and Expectations: Even though the women’s movement has made great strides since the time of our mothers, we still face gender-based discrimination, abuse and unrealistic expectations.  Outside of the home, women are routinely paid less than men for the same job, are penalized for taking maternity leave, and are discriminated against just because they have children. Organizations, businesses and culture in general just assumes men are the primary breadwinners and that women are out earning ‘extra’ money. At home, although male parents are starting to take on more responsibilities that traditionally fall under the ‘mom’ role, the majority of women are still viewed and expected to do all of the ‘female’ duties… taking care of the children, cleaning, laundry, getting groceries, cooking, etc., etc., The harmful effects of these societal gender roles and expectations?  Most women suffer in silence - with higher rates of depression, anxiety and exhaustion - being the result.",

When she became pregnant with her first child, she knew she wanted to stay home with her son – and that she wanted to raise him to be bilingual. It was during a Mom & Baby Yoga class that the idea for her business fully came to her. She had found the experience of learning something while simultaneously caring for her baby to be wonderful – what if she could teach French to both parents and their children? Soon after her moment of inspiration, Maan launched her education company, 123 Petit Pas. Today, the Ottawa, Canada-based mompreneur teaches virtual French classes to adults and their young wards across the globe through her company – all while working from home and caring for her own kids.

I think I’m mainly going to discuss my thoughts and feelings surrounding the reality of being diagnosed with “Borderline Personality Disorder” (BPD), especially the ones I felt when I was first diagnosed but we’ll see how it goes. This post has been the hardest to write so far. I’m not sure which aspects to focus on or what message I want to get across but anyway, I hope it is still insightful.",
        p2:"I use the “” when I write the diagnosis because I don’t quite agree with the name of it. What I feel the name says to those who know nothing about it, is that the person suffering has a ‘disordered personality’; there’s something ‘wrong’ with it and therefore with them as a person. Your personality is pretty much who you are and to have a label attached to it which basically calls it ‘disordered’ is a bit shitty to be honest. It’s not really surprising that there’s still a huge stigma attached to the “personality disorder” illnesses and I feel the name contributes to a large part of it.  I do NOT have a disordered personality, I am NOT flawed and my diagnosis does NOT define me as a person; it is NOT who I am.",
        p3:"Things have, however, changed slightly! BPD is now also known as “Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder” (EUPD) which admittedly does get shot of the outdated ‘borderline’ part of the name but, the ‘personality disorder’ is still present, therefore not changing much in my opinion. I believe that the connotations of the phrase ’emotionally unstable’ are still mostly negative and further contribute to the stigma. It is often debated that the ‘PD’ should be dropped completely. I’ve mentioned it in a previous post that BPD is thought to stem from trauma in childhood and therefore should be named something which reflects the trauma it is caused by. I tend to agree.",

In these tech clubs, young girls from Cape Town township high schools can learn ICT skills and are encouraged to take the leap into a career in tech. Casting her net wider to help women across Africa, she co-founded Peo ya Phetogo (PYP), a non-profit dedicated to digital skills development among our youth, schools, teachers and communities.",

        p1:"Thembiso Magajana is a self-confessed technophile from Gauteng who spent a decade in the financial sector before she found her true calling in code. It was a conversation with her then six-year-old niece who wanted to be the world’s next Steve Jobs – and being dismayed at how few black women there were in tech – that inspired her to leave the world of finance. Within months she was fully immersed in creating pathways for South African township youth to be part of the 4th Industrial Revolution.",
        p2:"Unlike our other tech heroines, Thembiso has no formal education in technology. However, when she decided she wanted a future in IT, she spent her free time reading Computer Programming For Dummies, watching Youtube tutorials, and studying various online coding and IT courses. Soon she was teaching her niece and friends basic coding in her sister’s garage, with limited wifi and only one laptop between them. That inspired her to launch Social Coding. Her background and training in finance has stood her in good stead, helping her secure funds and creating multiple revenue streams for her nonprofit.",
        p3:"Thembiso’s passion and drive have catapulted her into one of South Africa’s most recognised female tech movers and shakers. She has been recognised as a World Economic Forum Global Shaper and is an accomplished TEDx Speaker. In 2019 she was named one of the 50 most inspiring women in tech by @InspiringFifty SA, a non-profit that aims to increase diversity in tech by making female role models more visible. Her nonprofit, Social Coding, is where she has made a huge difference to thousands of disadvantaged girls and women. The technical workshops cover software development and design thinking and teach girls to be initiators, conceptualists, shapers, and drivers of innovative and strategic problem-solving.",
